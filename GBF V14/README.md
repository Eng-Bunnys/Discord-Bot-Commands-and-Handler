### Why is GBF now open source?
I feel like the users have the right to know what exactly is going on in GBF, seeing what goes on in GBF might help ease some anxiety since you know what is being done with the data
Also for anyone getting into discord bot making and wants ideas or needs help with a certain command, this might help!

### What is GBF?
GBF is a Discord Bot that aims to inform you with the current freebies so you never miss out!
It also provides logging, moderation and much more!
GBF was made to automate the freebie process that used to happen at `GBF OFFICES`
