## Data Protection
### Due to this version being free for public use rather than closed access compared to V1, data protection is very important.

Your data will be closed and inaccessible by anyone, the data is updated using a computer and there is no manual work this means that no human will be in-between you and your data.
You can request data deletion and that process will also be automatically done using a computer to ensure no human can view your data.

Your data is encrpyted using AES256-CBC [256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard in Cipher Block Chaining mode], this protects your data by encrypting your data from the client to the secure database.

## How to access for free

## New Features

- Enhanced system performance and less loading times:
This was done by greatly improving the code and general connections to the server.

### New display features:
1. Semester naming to help identifiy which data is for which group
2. Just finished session difference from average session data

### Removed in-compatible features
1. System time welcome messages
2. System time footers

### Added Multi-User support
Now the system supports multiple users but users are limited to their own commands so no one can manipulate your data without access to your account.
This also means that now many users can use the timer and track their data for free.

### Level system

Since the system is now open to the public, we find that having a progression system helps keep people interested, we plan to improve this system in the future.
1. Sesaonal level
This is a temporary level that resets after each season/semester.
2. Account level
This is a permenant level.

GBF Timers is now available for public use and the source code is now open source.
