# Fun Commands
These are the `Fun` commands, the games, chat revivers etc.

Code is somewhat old, aprox. 1.2 years old in some commands and they work and I don't see an issue with them so I probably won't update them soon.

## FYI
There is one file ,[me](https://github.com/DepressedBunnys/Discord.JS-Bot-Commands/blob/main/GBF/Fun%20Commands/Fun-SubCommands.js), that contains all of the commands combined, this is what runs in GBF
