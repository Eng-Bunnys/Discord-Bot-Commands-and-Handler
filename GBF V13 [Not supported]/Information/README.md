# Information
This folder contains 2 sub-folders that are seperated into 2 categories:
1- Bot Information
2- Server & User Information

Where Bot Information is mainly general bot stats like total users, uptime, ping, etc.
While Server & User Information is mainly general information like UserInformation, Avatar, ServerInformation, etc.

## FYI
Files that end with `SubCommands` are files that contain all of the files that you see in the folder in one file, this is what GBF runs off
